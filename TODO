To Do
---
Dev:
X clean up code
X filters
X conditional GET
x delete aggregates
X modify aggregates
X filters per-feed (per-aggr)
X unique feeds
X figure out a better updating scheme, esp. for feeds that don't support conditional GET
- document
- test
X generate RSS feeds of Aggregates
- users
X public/private aggregates
- document
- test
X subscribers to feeds
- replace non-autoescaping with selective escaping
- continuous historical data
    implies:
    - save posts as they're loaded
    - reload posts regularly with django-cron(?)
    - deduce optimum rate to reload feeds
- DOCUMENT
- TEST
- production error reporting
Beta:
- internal caching (Django)
- filtering based on other feed tags (author, date, category, tags, etc.)
- subscribers to public aggrs
- multithreaded feed fetching (see threadpool) [obsoleted?]
- search posts
- AJAX/single-page support
- redesign

Design:
X nav sidebar, anon vs. user
- basic layout of aggr details, front page(s)
- better-looking links/buttons ala Udacity
- jQuery tabs in sidebar

To Do
---
X clean up code
X filters
X conditional GET
x delete aggregates
X modify aggregates
X filters per-feed (per-aggr)
X unique feeds
X figure out a better updating scheme, esp. for feeds that don't support conditional GET
X generate RSS feeds of Aggregates
- users
- public/private aggregates
- design
- subscribers
- continuous historical data
    implies:
    - save posts as they're loaded
    - reload posts regularly with cron
    - deduce optimum rate to reload feeds
- internal caching (Django)
- filtering based on other feed tags (author, date, category, tags, etc.)
- multithreaded feed fetching (see threadpool)
- replace non-autoescaping with selective escaping
